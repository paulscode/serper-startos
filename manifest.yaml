  short: Self-sovereign Serper-compatible search API - own your AI's search capability.
  long: |
    Serper Clone is a self-sovereign, privacy-respecting search API that provides full 
    compatibility with the Serper.dev API format. Take back control of your AI workflows 
    by hosting your own search infrastructure - no subscriptions, no external API keys, 
    no data harvesting. Powered by SearXNG, aggregating results from multiple search 
    engines without tracking you.
    
    Perfect for AI applications like LangChain, AutoGPT, and custom tools that expect 
    a Serper-compatible API. Features include:
    
    - Full Serper API compatibility (/search, /news, /images)
    - Works with LangChain's GoogleSerperAPIWrapper
    - Configurable API key authentication
    - Self-sovereign: no external dependencies or subscriptions
    - Privacy-focused: aggregates results without tracking
    - Note: Places search has limited functionality compared to Google Maps
